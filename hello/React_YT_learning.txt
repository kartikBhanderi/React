15 - METHODS AS PROPS
-- how to pass method as props / how to access parent method from child
-- how to give parameters to parent method
-- pass method as props, call that method on particular event, if want to pass parameter then make arrow function structure to call the method
-- keep in mind that we need function not function call on particular event

16 - CONDITIONAL RENDERING
if else
element variable
ternary operator
short circuit operator

17 - LIST RENDERING
we can render list of objects using array.map
as a parameter define elements u want to render
if complext data is being rendered then create new component and pass data as props
-- in FC, use {} to directly evaluate the props

18 - LISTS AND KEYS
while building lists, always mention key PROPS where each item will have the unique key
KEY is a reserver props which is used for efficient UI update
 
19 - INDEX AS KEY
we can add INDEX parameter in arrow function and use it as a unique id for building the list
but it may result into serious issues with data when u'll try to mess up with list
so if list has unique feature then go with it
else if u want to use index then it should be static list and shouldn't be reordered or filtered
